# Site 74


## History
I began work on Site 74 in late October of 2017. Motivated by a sudden bout of interest in creating my own game, I decided to create my own variant of the popular SCP roleplay games on Roblox. Originally planned to be complete in a month, the project grew in scale and became far more ambitious.
Come late 2022 and the game had still not been completed. This is largely in part due to repeated attempts at restarting development, each successive attempt being less effective than the last.
