# Site 74

## History
I began work on Site 74 in late October of 2017. Motivated by a sudden bout of interest in creating my own game, I decided to create my own variant of the popular SCP roleplay games on Roblox. Originally planned to be complete in a month, the project grew in scale and became far more ambitious.
Come late 2022 and the game had still not been completed. This is largely in part due to repeated attempts at restarting development, each successive attempt being less effective than the last.

## Why Roblox?
Admittedly, Roblox is a very limited platform to create games on. It also has a certain reputation for being marketted towards children, which is undoubtedly true. However, there are many games on the platform that are targetted towards more mature audiences.
Here are some key considerations I made when selecting to develop this game on Roblox:
- I am intimately familiar with Roblox game development
- I am fluent in Lua
- There already exists a large target audience for this genre
- There is no cost for hosting servers on Roblox
- Advertising can be performed directly on the Roblox website
- Existing similar games like Site 74 have been incredibly financially successful

## Snippets
Feel free to peruse the various snippets found in the [Snippets folder](https://github.com/StevieGoodman/site_74/tree/release/snippets).
Please bear in mind that Roblox uses an extension to Lua called [Luau](https://luau-lang.org), but the files are in Lua because Luau files do not support syntax highlighting.
